Hey! 👋 My name is Matt. I'm a 🤓 nerd, 🎮 gamer, 🧑‍💻 software engineer, 🎨 martial artist. I play games and occasionally try making one.

I am a full-stack software engineer and a site reliability engineer with a focus on building tools and services that are resilient, scalable, and ideally easy to develop and operate. My focus is making the lives of others easier through my efforts. Plus I get to solve some really hard problems sometimes, both technical and not, and collaborate with others so win-win!

Current project(s):
- 🏰 Simulating a fantasy 15th century economy with traveling merchants, armies, and bandits. It sounded like something I could learn more about 🤖 AI with and get to explore my love of 📚 history and 💰 economics more. Maybe I can use it in running a 🎲 tabletop RPG one day as well.
- Continuing to learn electric bass. 🎸🤘

Also, metal music is awesome. :metal: Here's some songs, in no particular order: [Ghost Division](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9FkYxnm70vg), [Awakening](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqUPGa15Oto), [Any Means Necessary](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkmlujV-TvU), [Cleanse the Bloodlines](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfSL-6YExzk), [A Man With A Plan](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bc0sJvtKrRM), [Pisces](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQNtGoM3FVU), [Northwest Passage](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRD3vrSLPaw)
